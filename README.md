# PortfolioProjects

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you will find a collection of my data analysis projects, showcasing my skills in Python, SQL, and Excel. Each project highlights a different aspect of my expertise, from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to building predictive models and creating interactive dashboards.

## Projects

### 1. Regression Modeling in Python (FourFactorsPortfolio)
**Description:**  
This project involves utilizing Python in analyzing NBA team data from the 2022-2024 seasons with a focus on the basketball “Four Factors”.

**Key Tasks:**
- Analyzed team statistics using several libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, focusing on the "Four Factors".
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data, then conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to obtain preliminary insights before testing.
- Developed linear and logistic regression models to analyze the impact of the "Four Factors" on winning and to predict playoff qualification accuracy.

### 2. Correlation Analysis in Python (MoviePortfolio)
**Description:**  
This project investigates a movie dataset in Python to identify features with the highest correlation to gross earnings.

**Key Tasks:**
- Analyzed a movie dataset using libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, focusing on identifying features that most strongly correlate with gross earnings.
- Transformed and cleaned the dataset to prepare for analysis through EDA.
- Developed a comprehensive correlation matrix for all variables and identified key features by filtering for strong positive correlation values (> 0.5).

### 3. Data Exploration in SQL (NBAStatsPortfolio)
**Description:**  
This project leverages SQLite to perform extensive EDA on an NBA dataset, with a specific focus on the Minnesota Timberwolves, to discover team/league leaders in particular statistics.

**Key Tasks:**
- Utilized queries, joins, window functions, CTEs, temporary tables, and more to perform extensive EDA on an NBA dataset.
- Analyzed statistics across different categories for players from the Timberwolves and other teams in the league to identify top performers and underperformers.

### 4. Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard (CoffeeSalesPortfolio)
**Description:**  
This project features an interactive Excel Dashboard displaying a coffee shop's sales by market, product type, and sales over time.

**Key Tasks:**
- Created an interactive Excel Dashboard to display coffee shop sales data.
- Visualized sales by market, product type, and over time to provide clear and actionable insights.
